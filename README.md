# AIRLINE-REVIEW-ANALYSIS
As a Data Scientist at British Airways (BA), I have Performed Web Scraping and analyse customer review data to uncover findings for British Airways using BeautifulSoup, Python and provide some insight into the content of the reviews with topic modelling, sentiment analysis and word cloud using Natural Language Processing Algorithms. I completed this task using Python.

### Scrape data from the web
scraping and collecting customer feedback and reviewing data from a third-party source and analysing this data to present any insights you may uncover.
Website: scrape review data from the web (https://www.airlinequality.com/)
The team leader wants to focus on reviews specifically about the airline itself and should collect as much data as. So, we can in order to improve the output of analysis. I have used “Jupyter Notebook” with Python for the data collection.

### Analyse data
Once I collected my dataset, I prepared data. The data was messy and contain purely text. I performed data cleaning in order to prepare the data for analysis. When the data is clean, I perform my analysis to uncover some insights. As a starting point, I implemented topic modelling, sentiment analysis or wordclouds to provide some insight into the content of the reviews. I completed this task using Python. 

### Present insights
summarise all findings within a single PowerPoint slide, so that I presented the results at the meeting.
